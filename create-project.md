# Creating a project
{: #setup-project}

In a [project](#x2035151){: term}, you can add deployable architectures from the catalog and customize their configuration. Deploying a configuration from a project groups resources based on the configuration that you deployed.Â 
{: shortdesc}



You can create a project by going to the **Navigation menu** icon ![Navigation Menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg "Menu") and selecting **[Projects](/projects/)** or from a deployable architecture in the [catalog](/catalog/). Projects can also be created by using the [Project API](https://{DomainName}/apidocs/projects).



## Before you begin
{: #prereq-project}

Resources are created in the project account for the user. You must have permission to create a project and permission to create the project tooling resources within the account. Make sure that you have the following access:

* The Editor role on the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Projects service.
* The Editor and Manager role on the {{site.data.keyword.bplong}} service
* The Viewer role on the resource group for the project

For more information about access and permissions, see [Assigning users access to projects](/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-access-project).





## Adding users to a project
{: #add-users-project}






Project access is controlled by {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Identity and Access Management (IAM). You add users to a project by granting the Reader role or higher on the project instance. For more information on assigning access to projects, see [Assigning users access to projects](/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-access-project).



## Adding a deployable architecture to a project
{: #add-deployment-project}






Deployable architectures that you add to a project are represented as configurations in the project UI. After you add a deployable architecture to a project, you can edit your configuration before you deploy it. There are a couple of ways to add a deployable architecture to your project.

To add a deployable architecture to your project from the project dashboard, complete the following steps:

1. From the project dashboard, select the Configurations tab.
1. Click **Create**.
1. Select a deployable architecture from the catalog.
1. Click **Review deployment options**.
1. Click **Add to project**.

You can also add a deployable architecture to a project directly from the catalog:

1. Go to the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog](/catalog).
1. Select the deployable architecture.
1. Click **Review deployment options**.
1. Click **Add to project**.
1. You can create a new project or add to an existing project.
1. Enter the required details for the deployable architecture.
1. Click **Add**.

Check out the steps on how to [configure and deploy a deployable architecture](/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-config-project) when you're ready to deploy resources from a deployable architecture from a project.
